This is a map interface I am currently developing for Columbia Basin Research, part of the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences at the University of Washington. This map is intended to show a list of locations a user can choose from (still being developed), and then highlight the location on the map when selected. There are many different base layers and additional layers that provide additional information to the user.
